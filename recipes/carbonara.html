        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This dish is a <strong> deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll </strong>that has been pasta-fied, fancified, fetishized and turned into an Italian tradition that, 
            like many inviolate Italian traditions, is actually far less old than the Mayflower. Because America may have contributed to its creation,
             carbonara is Exhibit A in the back-and-forth between Italy and the United States when it comes to food. Remember: the main goal is creaminess.</p>
